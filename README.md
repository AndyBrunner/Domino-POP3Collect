# Domino-POP3-Collect
Domino POP3 Collect Add-In Server Task

The POP3 Collect add-in task for Lotus Domino reads messages from one or more POP3 servers and sends them to the Domino server or any other SMTP Server (Exchange, Postfix, Sendmail, etc). It is written entirely in Java to support all Domino versions (since 8.0) and processor architectures (32-bit, 64-bit and 128-bit) on all platforms.
